# CalculatorAndroidApp

This is a simple android calculator capable of the 4 basic functions as well as percent and square root.

# What I learned

* Worked more with constraint layout settings.
* Worked with using grid lines and auto-align features.
* This was the first project where I worked heavily with UI and design features.

# Rewarding Outcome

This was the first android application that I made to scale nicely with any screen in any orientation.
